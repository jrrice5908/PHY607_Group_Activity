# PHY607_Group_Activity

Goal: simulate the force of drag on a spherical cow in a fluid of N particles with gravity. 

#Requirements:

- Main-Level Analy-level script that initializes the system, runs simulation loop, and collects data for analysis
- Scripts for visualizing the trajectory of the projectile (spherical cow) and the fluid particles, plotting the velocity and drag force over time.
- Core modules for calculating forces between particles, updating positions and velocities, and handling boundary conditions.
- Test module that verifies the accuracy and stability of the force calculations and the integration scheme.
